 anonimous block in not in the mysql, it is in the pl/sql which is oracle base .so it has a concept of anonimous block.
Ans:-
The error message doesn't match the code you posted. There is no dbms_output.put_line in your posted code and in MySQL. Also PL/SQL is Oracle specific. MySQL doesn't understand that. It's got it's own procedural extension. –
